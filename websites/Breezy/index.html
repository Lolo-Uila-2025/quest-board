      <h2>Arduino</h2>
      <p>What is an Arduino?
An Arduino is something that we in lolo uilo use to be able to code things and connect 
stuff together and give it energy.

      <h2> Arduino project</h2>
      <p>Some of my favorite projects is the LED lights, i thought is was cool that we could make our own colos and even make them flash on and off or to different colors.

    <h2>Arduino</h2>
    <p><strong>What is your favorite Arduino part? (ex: buzzer, LED, LCD, potentiometer) and why?</strong><br>
      I liked the LEDs the most because I was able to customize them more, and I could connect more than one at a time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is an Arduino?</strong><br>
      An Arduino is something that we in Lolo Uila use to be able to code things and connect stuff together and give it energy.

    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you teach an AI using machine learning? What did it learn to do?</strong><br>
      I taught AI to know who I am by taking a bunch of photos of myself in a bunch of different angles. And we also had to take pictures of different hand motions so they could detect them.

    <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p><strong>Why is encryption and decryption important?</strong><br>
      Encryption and decryption is important for cybersecurity, privacy, and maintaining data in the digital age.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example of Caesar Cipher:</strong><br>
      <em>Original:</em> Touch grass<br>
      <em>Encrypted:</em> SNTBG FQZRR<br>
      <em>Shift:</em> 1 to the left or 25 to the right

    <h2>Lolo Uila Experience</h2>
    <p><strong>What’s one part of Lolo Uila you really enjoyed? What made it fun?</strong><br>
      One part is the scavenger hunt. I liked being outside for class and walking around the campus with my classmates. It made me use my brain more and made me talk to others and get to know them more.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What’s one part of Lolo Uila that was difficult? How did you deal with it?</strong><br>
      Making my code was pretty difficult, but our kumu were very patient with me and would help me understand it way more.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Rez-Life</h2>
    <p><strong>What was your favorite activity during Rez-life?</strong><br>
      Sleeping because they worked us all day, and I didn’t get to be able to wind down. Going into my friends' rooms and being able to talk story and chill was super fun.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Summer Institute Reflection</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you feel about this year’s Summer Institute? Would you like to return next year?</strong><br>
      I feel like it gave me more experience and it gave me an opportunity to get out of my shell and meet new people. I would rate it a 6 or 7 out of 10, only because the rez made things hard to stay, but Uncle Cody, Aunty Jaz, Jonahvan, and Uncle Kila made things a lot better. I would think about coming back next summer.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I enjoyed being able to code and make things with the Arduino. The most fun part was being creative with LEDs and learning how to teach AI using machine learning. What challenged me the most was coding, but with help from my kumu, I got better at understanding it. Overall, this class pushed me and helped me grow.</p>
